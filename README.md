Python APIs... Let's go get the data!

OBSERVATIONS:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Observation - Temperature is higher close to the equator

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Observation - No correlation between humidity and latitude

* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Observation - No correlation between cloudiness and latitude

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Observation - No correlation between wind speed and latitude

Your next objective is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
=>Inverse relationship between temperature and latitude, temperature increases as latitude decreases

* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
=>Correlated relationship between temperature and latitude, temperature increases as latitude increases

* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
No relationship

* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
No relationship

* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
No relationship

* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
No relationship

* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
No relationship

* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
No relationship
